# 🩺 VitalLens-AI-App

**VitalLens-AI-App** is an intelligent health diagnostics tool that leverages machine learning to provide predictive insights into a user’s vital health metrics. By analyzing parameters such as age, body temperature, weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol, the app classifies whether a user is likely at risk of underlying health issues like hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or abnormal body temperature conditions — all without invasive tests.

This project is built with AWS Cloud technologies (Lambda, API Gateway, SageMaker, Amplify) using the AWS Free Tier, and integrates with a React-based frontend. It follows industry standards in cloud architecture and machine learning.

## ✅ Features

- 🔍 AI-driven prediction of health risks using basic vital signs.
- 📊 Trained model using `RandomForestClassifier` with realistic synthetic data.
- ☁️ Hosted on AWS (Amplify, Lambda, API Gateway, S3).
- 🧠 SageMaker-ready model training notebook (`sagemaker_notebook.ipynb`).
- 🔒 Secure, serverless backend using AWS Lambda.
- 📱 Interactive and mobile-responsive frontend (React).
- 📦 Easy to deploy and extend.
- 👩‍⚕️ Empowers early health intervention and monitoring in underserved regions.

## 📈 How It Works

1. **User Input**  
   The frontend collects age, weight, body temperature, blood pressure, and cholesterol level.

2. **Prediction Logic**  
   Data is sent via API Gateway to a Lambda function (`predict.py`) which loads a pre-trained model (`health_model.pkl`) and returns the prediction (Healthy / At Risk).

3. **Model Training**  
   Model is trained offline with synthetic yet realistic health data using `RandomForestClassifier` and stored as `health_model.pkl`.

4. **Cloud Hosting**  
   Frontend is hosted using AWS Amplify. Model and Lambda backend are deployed using CloudFormation.

## ⚙️ Deployment (Beginner-Friendly Steps)

### ✅ Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- AWS Free Tier account
- Node.js and npm installed
- AWS CLI configured
- Python 3.8+

### 📦 Step 1: Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BishopDavid7/VitalLens-AI-App.git
cd VitalLens-AI-App
````

### 🧠 Step 2: Train and Save the Model

```bash
cd backend/model
python3 generate_health_model.py
```

### 🧪 Step 3: Test the Lambda Function Locally

```bash
cd ../lambda
python3 predict.py  # Optional for local testing
```

### 🧰 Step 4: Deploy Backend Using AWS CloudFormation

```bash
cd ../../cloudformation
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file template.yaml \
  --stack-name vitallens-stack \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

### 🎨 Step 5: Setup Frontend with React

```bash
cd ../../react-app
npm install
npm start  # For local dev
```

### ☁️ Step 6: Deploy Frontend to AWS Amplify

1. Commit code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

2. Go to [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify)
3. Connect your GitHub repo: `https://github.com/BishopDavid7/VitalLens-AI-App`
4. Amplify will auto-deploy your frontend
